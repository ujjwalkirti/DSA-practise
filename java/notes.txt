These are actually the good ones. Rest are slops imo.

1. Sliding Window
2. Two Pointers
3. Binary Search
4. Hash Map Patterns (frequency / prefix)
5. Stack Monotonic Stack
6. Heaps Priority Queue (Top K)
7. Intervals Merge + Sweep Line
8. Linked List (fast slow, reverse, cycle)
9. Trees DFS BFS (recursion, level order)
10. Dynamic Programming (1D/2D, knapsack, LIS)
